    <h1>Tortoise, turtle and sea turtle</h1>
     <p>
      Surprise, they’re ALL turtles! “Turtle” refers to all species in that group – including tortoises and sea turtles. Typically, tortoises live entirely on land, while sea turtles live entirely in the water – they only come on land to lay eggs. Turtles spend time in the water and on land. Sadly, many species of turtle are endangered! 129 of approximately 300 species of turtle and tortoise on Earth today are either vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered, according to the IUCN. Threats include loss of habitat, poaching and the illegal pet trade.

       <h2>Tortoise</h2>
       <ul>
        <li style="color:red;">Tortoises are land animals</li> 
       <li>Their feet are round and stumpy, adapted for walking on land, also dig burrows with their strong forelimbs, and slip underground when the sun gets too hot</li> 
       <li>The turtle class, of which tortoises are a family, dates back to the late Triassic period. This age coincides with the first dinosaurs, and unlike other evolved species, the land turtle has not changed much from that time period. One difference in the modern tortoise from its ancestor is that Triassic turtles originally had teeth, while the modern tortoise has a beak</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Funny facts</h5>
             <ol>
             <li>Turtles aren’t silent. Although they’re not likely to be as loud as dogs or cats, turtles do make a range of noises, anything from chicken-like clucks to dog-like barking, depending on the species</li>
             <li>Turtles have a second shell. Besides their outer shell, turtles also have a lower shell, called a plastron</li>
             <li>Trutles breath through their butt</li>
             <li class="rtu-class"> There’s no place like home. Female marine turtles return to the same nesting grounds where they were born when it’s time for them to lay their own eggs</li>
             <li id="my-special-id-1"class="rtu-class"> Just keep swimming. Male sea turtles spend almost their whole life at sea because, unlike females, they don’t have to return to land to nest.</li>
             <li class="rtu-class"> Turtle tears. Turtles do cry, but not because they’re sad. They have glands that help to empty excess salt from their eyes, which makes it look like they’re crying.</li>
